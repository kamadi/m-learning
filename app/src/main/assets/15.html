    <h1>Random Access Memory</h1>

    <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and
        program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As
        soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</p>

    <p>Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside the
        memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the
        RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.</p>
    <p>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there
        is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with
        computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can
        hold.</p>
    <p>RAM is of two types âˆ’</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
        <li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Static RAM (SRAM)</h2>
    <p>The word <b>static</b> indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is
        being supplied. However, data is lost when the power gets down due to volatile nature. SRAM
        chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors. Transistors do not require power to
        prevent leakage, so SRAM need not be refreshed on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>There is extra space in the matrix, hence SRAM uses more chips than DRAM for the same amount
        of storage space, making the manufacturing costs higher. SRAM is thus used as cache memory
        and has very fast access.</p>
    <h3>Characteristic of Static RAM</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Long life</li>
        <li>No need to refresh</li>
        <li>Faster</li>
        <li>Used as cache memory</li>
        <li>Large size</li>
        <li>Expensive</li>
        <li>High power consumption</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</h2>
    <p>DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually <b>refreshed</b> in order to maintain the data. This
        is done by placing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred
        times per second. DRAM is used for most system memory as it is cheap and small. All DRAMs
        are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.</p>
    <h3>Characteristics of Dynamic RAM</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Short data lifetime</li>
        <li>Needs to be refreshed continuously</li>
        <li>Slower as compared to SRAM</li>
        <li>Used as RAM</li>
        <li>Smaller in size</li>
        <li>Less expensive</li>
        <li>Less power consumption</li>
    </ul>
