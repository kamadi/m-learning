    <p>Today’s world is an information-rich world and it has become a necessity for everyone to know
        about computers. A computer is an electronic data processing device, which accepts and
        stores data input, processes the data input, and generates the output in a required
        format.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to Computers and its fundamentals.</p>
    <h2>Functionalities of a Computer</h2>
    <p>If we look at it in a very broad sense, any digital computer carries out the following five
        functions −</p>
    <p><b>Step 1</b> − Takes data as input.</p>
    <p><b>Step 2</b> − Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.</p>
    <p><b>Step 3</b> − Processes the data and converts it into useful information.</p>
    <p><b>Step 4</b> − Generates the output.</p>
    <p><b>Step 5</b> − Controls all the above four steps.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of Computers</h2>
    <p>Following are certain advantages of computers.</p>
    <h3>High Speed</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Computer is a very fast device.</p></li>
        <li><p>It is capable of performing calculation of very large amount of data.</p></li>
        <li><p>The computer has units of speed in microsecond, nanosecond, and even the
            picosecond.</p></li>
        <li><p>It can perform millions of calculations in a few seconds as compared to man who will
            spend many months to perform the same task.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Accuracy</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>In addition to being very fast, computers are very accurate.</p></li>
        <li><p>The calculations are 100% error free.</p></li>
        <li><p>Computers perform all jobs with 100% accuracy provided that the input is correct.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Storage Capability</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Memory is a very important characteristic of computers.</p></li>
        <li><p>A computer has much more storage capacity than human beings.</p></li>
        <li><p>It can store large amount of data.</p></li>
        <li><p>It can store any type of data such as images, videos, text, audio, etc.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Diligence</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Unlike human beings, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness, and lack of
            concentration.</p></li>
        <li><p>It can work continuously without any error and boredom.</p></li>
        <li><p>It can perform repeated tasks with the same speed and accuracy.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Versatility</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>A computer is a very versatile machine.</p></li>
        <li><p>A computer is very flexible in performing the jobs to be done.</p></li>
        <li><p>This machine can be used to solve the problems related to various fields.</p></li>
        <li><p>At one instance, it may be solving a complex scientific problem and the very next
            moment it may be playing a card game.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reliability</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>A computer is a reliable machine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Modern electronic components have long lives.</p></li>
        <li><p>Computers are designed to make maintenance easy.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Automation</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Computer is an automatic machine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Automation is the ability to perform a given task automatically. Once the computer
            receives a program i.e., the program is stored in the computer memory, then the program
            and instruction can control the program execution without human interaction.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reduction in Paper Work and Cost</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>The use of computers for data processing in an organization leads to reduction in
            paper work and results in speeding up the process.</p></li>
        <li><p>As data in electronic files can be retrieved as and when required, the problem of
            maintenance of large number of paper files gets reduced.</p></li>
        <li><p>Though the initial investment for installing a computer is high, it substantially
            reduces the cost of each of its transaction.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages of Computers</h2>
    <p>Following are certain disadvantages of computers.</p>
    <h3>No I.Q.</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>A computer is a machine that has no intelligence to perform any task.</p></li>
        <li><p>Each instruction has to be given to the computer.</p></li>
        <li><p>A computer cannot take any decision on its own.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dependency</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>It functions as per the user’s instruction, thus it is fully dependent on humans.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>The operating environment of the computer should be dust free and suitable.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>No Feeling</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Computers have no feelings or emotions.</p></li>
        <li><p>It cannot make judgment based on feeling, taste, experience, and knowledge unlike
